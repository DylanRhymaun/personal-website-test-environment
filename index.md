      ###Galactix

      <p>I was really excited to get back into Game making for the 2024 GMTK jam, but my contributions were smaller than I hoped this year. I assembled a team of 7 this time, making it clear that I focused on 3D art, but the team took a turn and opted for a 2D game. I made the UI, title screen, player, enemy, and machine sprites, but the really impressive pixel art was done by a pixel artist I asked to join last minute. Lessons for next time I guess.</p>
      ###Space Ops

      <p>I served as the sole artist on a team of 4 people for the 2021 GMTK game jam. Space Ops was a simple wave based top down shooter. Pretty fun to work on, not the most impressive game ever made.</p>    </section>
