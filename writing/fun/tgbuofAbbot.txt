<h2>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly of Abbot Elementary</h2?
<p>Why am I bothering to write so much about a show I'm not fond of, let alone one I want to succeed in theory?</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p> 
#Janelle James, Chris Perfetti, Zack Fox, set design, concept
<p></p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p> 
#Unrealistic dilemmas, the office ripoff, child actor logistics
<p></p>

<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p> 
#The simplification of progressive ideas, willy abbot biollionaire, lack of critique of capitalism
#Leftist art teacher made an annoying stereotype, White Liberal character being conflated with progressive lunacy, a lack of noting overworking of teachers
<p></p>
