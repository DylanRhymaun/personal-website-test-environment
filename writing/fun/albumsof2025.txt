<h2>Forever Howlong - Black Country, New Road</h2>

<h2>Heavy Metal - Cameron Winter</h2>
<p>I saw this album floating around in the charts on Rateyourmusic and on twitter, but other than the striking album art it didn't seem to descript. </p>

<h2>Blush - Kevin Abstract & Co.</h2>
<p>If you were to think about albums as meals, a lot of them would make you physically sick by the end. Maybe not because each plate/song is unpleasant, but moreso because it's a lot of the same. Nobody wants 15 ribeyes in a row. <em>Blush</em> is a diverse tasting menu from one of the top restaurants in the world. There is not a song on this album I'd rank below a 9/10 and every one is unique.<br>If you're reading this, you probably know me and might have expected me to put a Brockhampton member in this list somewhere. That said, I didn't expect so personally because Kevin Abstract's last solo album <em>Blanket</em> had some high points but was mostly forgettable. The difference in quality obviously comes from the collaboration that took place on this album. The success of Brockhampton was not that each member individually could create what they did, it came from them bouncing each others ideas off the wall and seeing what stuck. No one person had the final say on what something sounded like. Despite this being listed as a solo project, Kevin has made it clear that "Blush" is a loose collective. It just so happens that that collective involves some of the greatest working talents in the industry right now, namely JPEGMafia, Quadeca, and Romil Hemnani, as well as introducing tons of no-name artists which will deservedly blow up after this album gains traction (Love Spells, Derby). <br>
My only major issue with this album that I have to note is the inclusion of Ameer Vann. Ameer was famously kicked out of Brockhampton in 2018 due to allegations of sexual misconduct by multiple women. Moreover, in 2024, fellow Brockhampton member Dom McKlennon claimed that Ameer also set him up to be robbed following his dismissal from the group. Ameer is talented and Kevin and him have been good friends since high school, yet I take serious issue with Kevin including him on the album as it associates the other talents on this album, and the listener, with Kevin's forgiveness of the man. Ameer appears on 4/18 songs.<br> </p>

<h2>Even in Arcadia - Sleep Token</h2>
<p>Don't stop reading. It's hard to understand the level of hate this band receives as someone who casually appreciates metal. From what I've read, critics most commonly criticize this album and band for genre flipping into pop rock. <br> I ha<strong>d</strong> one big criticism with this band until recently and that was their anonymity. However many listens to this album, I realized their anonymity was necessary to elude criticisms of their dramaticism.  </p>
