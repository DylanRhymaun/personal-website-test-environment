<p>There's some country artists who have cross genre appeal based on their musical style. I'm talking about the Kacey Musgraves and early Taylor Swifts out there - subtle accents and lyrics that avoid the usual dirt road, bud light, pickup truck nonsense. Then, there's the other type of mud sligning country artists who somehow just get so huge that they're hard to ignore. Even I like a couple Chris Stapleton songs out there. <br>
Jess Williamson is a really small artist who, despite her relatively long career at this point, does not compromise one way or the other. She doesn't hide her roots, yet just so happens to make some of the most moving and passionate music I have ever heard. <br>
I am unfortunatley not versed enough in describing genre - or music in general - to talk about her range and precision in the way I wish, but I wanted to write a little blurb because her work has been on my mind. <br>
I highly reccomend checking out her most recent two albums <em>Time Aint Accidental</em> and <em>Sorceress</em>, as well as her collaboration with Waxahatchee on the album <em>I Walked With You a Ways</em> under the name Plains. "Problem With it" from the latter deserves 100 times more views than it has. </p>

<p>These guys may be my catalyst for learning Spanish. Thanks Tiny Desk.</p>

<p>This group only has a few singles under their belt but I'm already a fan. Can't wait for a full release.</p>
